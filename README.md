# Product-Comparator
J2EE Project for school

The goal of this project was to :
**Develop a price comparing web application**

We had 5 requirements that we had to use to define the OO-model.
So we beginned by doing the specifications in UML.
After that we had to set up the JDBC environment and implement the data access layer.
We also have integrated JPA in our project to have an exmaple.
We've developped a JPA data access layer with the mapping of entities
We tried to write some exmaples of requests with CriteriaQueries or JPQL.

Once the Data Access Layer ready, we beginned to implement the business layer.
And after that, we implement the servlets giving access to the business functionalities.

And to finish we had to developp the JSP page for the visual side.
